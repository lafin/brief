 * Matches sets of features {mi} and {m′j} extracted from two images taken
 * from similar, and often successive, viewpoints. A classical procedure
 * runs as follows. For each point {mi} in the first image, search in a
 * region of the second image around location {mi} for point {m′j}. The
 * search is based on the similarity of the local image windows, also known
 * as kernel windows, centered on the points, which strongly characterizes
 * the points when the images are sufficiently close. Once each keypoint is
 * described with its binary string, they need to be compared with the
 * closest matching point. Distance metric is critical to the performance of
 * in- trusion detection systems. Thus using binary strings reduces the size
 * of the descriptor and provides an interesting data structure that is fast
 * to operate whose similarity can be measured by the Hamming distance.
